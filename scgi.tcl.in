# This is a Simple Common Gateway Interface (SCGI) handler implemented as a
# multi-threaded server using the Tcl programming language.  Each request is
# first parsed by the main thread then dispatched to be served by a dedicated
# thread.  The scgi.tcl software requires Tcl 8.6 and the Thread extension.
#
# The SCGI specification is here: http://www.python.ca/scgi/protocol.txt .
#
# See README.md for documentation.
